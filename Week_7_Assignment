How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
- You need a hypothesis (null hypothesis is the default assumption that there is no significant difference/effect of what is being measured/observed.)
- Identify a test statistic, to assess how the data validates or rejects teh null hypothesis.
- Obtain a p-value, " or probability value, is a number describing the likelihood of obtaining the observed data under the null hypothesis of a statistical test." 
    - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/p-value.asp
- Need a significance level (alpha, arbitrary, but usually .05) to decide whether to reject/accept the null hypothesis.
  - if p-value is less than the significance level, reject the null and conclude that result is statistically significant.

What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
- "In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of a sample will approximate a normal distribution (i.e., a bell curve) as the sample size becomes 
  larger, regardless of the population's actual distribution shape. Put another way, CLT is a statistical premise that, given a sufficiently large sample size from a population 
  with a finite level of variance, the mean of all sampled variables from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean of the whole population. Furthermore, these 
  samples will approximate a normal distribution, with their variances being approximately equal to the variance of the population as the sample size gets larger, according to the 
  law of large numbers." https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central_limit_theorem.asp
- It is important because the CLT allows for normal approximation of many statistical distributions. It is the basis for statistical tests (z, t). Helps derive confidence intervals 
  from the population paramters. And helps understand behavior of sampling distributions, means, etc.

What is the statistical power?
- "Statistical power, or sensitivity, is the likelihood of a significance test detecting an effect when there actually is one. A true effect is a real, non-zero relationship 
  between variables in a population. An effect is usually indicated by a real difference between groups or a correlation between variables. High power in a study indicates a 
  large chance of a test detecting a true effect. Low power means that your test only has a small chance of detecting a true effect or that the results are likely to be distorted 
  by random and systematic error. Power is mainly influenced by sample size, effect size, and significance level. A power analysis can be used to determine the necessary sample 
  size for a study." https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/statistical-power/
  - Factors that impact statistical power include: effect size (larger increases power), sample size (larger increases power), significance level (lower decreases power), standard
  deviation (smaller increases power).
- Type I error (reject a null hypothesis that is true) and Type II errors (fail to reject a null hypothesis that is false) - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557530/


How do you control for biases?
- Data:
  - Avoid selection bias: Ensure data sample is representative of the target population.
  - Data Quality: Clean data from errors, nulls, inconsistencies, etc, and use appropriate feature engineering to minize bias.
- Model selection/evaluation:
  - Use fairness metrics to evaluate models.
  - Prevent overfitting of model.


What are confounding variables?
- "A confounder is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a spurious association". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding
- "A confounding variable is an extraneous variable that is not appropriately controlled in a study, which can result in it being unequally present in the comparison groups. 
  This variable can potentially influence the outcome of the study and obscure the true relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable."

What is A/B testing?
- Comparing the control group (A) against a test group (B) to assess whether a variable had an observable impact on the results.
- The null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between groups A and B. The alternative hypothesis would state that there is a difference. 
- The test statistic could be a z-test or t-test.
- if p-value is less than the significance level (.05), we determine that the difference is statistically significant and reject the null hypothesis. 

What are confidence intervals?
- These is a "range of values, bounded above and below the statistic's mean, that likely would contain an unknown population parameter". https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confidenceinterval.asp
  - A smaller confidence interval indicates higher precision.
